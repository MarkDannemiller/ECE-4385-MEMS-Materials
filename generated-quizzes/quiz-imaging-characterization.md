Question 1
10 / 10 pts
What is the primary goal of Failure Analysis (FA) in semiconductor and MEMS devices?
x To systematically determine the root cause of device failures and guide improvements
To increase device power consumption
To speed up packaging without regard to reliability
To reduce the number of inspection steps in manufacturing

Question 2
10 / 10 pts
What is the main purpose of using the “5 Whys” method in Failure Analysis?
x To iteratively dig down to the underlying human or process root cause of a problem
To generate five different test conditions for a device
To classify failures into five categories
To estimate the remaining lifetime of a device in five steps

Question 3

Which of the following is a non-destructive Failure Analysis technique?
x Scanning Acoustic Microscopy (SAM)
Focused Ion Beam (FIB) cross-sectioning
Mechanical grinding and polishing
Chemical delayering

Question 4
10 / 10 pts
Which statement best describes Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)?
x It uses a focused electron beam to produce high-resolution images of surface topography and composition
It uses ultrasonic waves to detect delamination and voids in encapsulated devices
It measures temperature distribution using infrared radiation
It only provides low-magnification optical images of device packages

Question 5
10 / 10 pts
In SEM-based analysis, what is the role of Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS)?
x To identify elemental composition by analyzing characteristic X-rays emitted from the sample
To measure mechanical displacement and velocity of vibrating structures
To generate acoustic images of internal voids in a package
To determine device temperature during power cycling tests
