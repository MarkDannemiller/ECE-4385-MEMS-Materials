Question 2
10 / 10 pts
Which of the following is an advantage of microfluidics?
x Less sample and reagent consumption (V ∝ L³)
Greater signal for sensing (V ∝ L³)
Turbulent flow that enhances mixing (high Re)
Easy out-of-plane fabrication

Question 3
10 / 10 pts
Which of the following is a disadvantage of microfluidics?
x Laminar flow leading to slow mixing
Portable, point-of-use operation
Single-chip integration (µTAS, lab-on-a-chip)
Relatively low cost

Question 4
10 / 10 pts
As the characteristic length L of a microfluidic channel decreases, which of the following quantities decrease? (Select all that apply.)
x Sample/reagent volume (V ∝ L³)
x Reynolds number (Re ∝ U₀L)
x Diffusion time (τD ∝ L²)
Surface-to-volume ratio (A/V ∝ L⁻¹)

Question 5
10 / 10 pts
Which of the following best describes a “lab-on-a-chip” or µTAS system?
x A single-chip device integrating sensing, pumping, valving, and analysis
A macroscopic reactor for bulk chemical synthesis only
A purely mechanical system with no fluidics or sensing
A device used only for fuel cell applications

Question 6
10 / 10 pts
Which material is most commonly associated with soft microfluidic device fabrication by molding and is often bonded to glass using plasma oxidation?
x PDMS (polydimethylsiloxane)
Silicon
Stainless steel
FR-4 (printed circuit board material)

Question 7
10 / 10 pts
Which bonding method is correctly matched to the substrate pair?
x Plasma oxidation: PDMS–PDMS or PDMS–glass
Anodic bonding: PDMS–PDMS
Thermocompression/fusion bonding: glass–plastic
Adhesive bonding: only silicon–silicon

Question 8
10 / 10 pts
Which of the following is a sensing technique commonly used in microfluidic lab-on-a-chip devices?
x Fluorescence detection
Gravitational wave interferometry
X-ray crystallography
Magnetic resonance imaging (whole-body scale)

Question 9
10 / 10 pts
For flow in a microchannel, which statement about the Reynolds number Re is correct?
x Re = Vd/ν and Re < 2000 generally indicates laminar flow
Re = ν/(Vd) and Re > 10 always indicates laminar flow
Re = V²d/ν and is independent of channel size
Re is not relevant at the microscale

10 / 10 pts
Which of the following are examples of microfluidic pumping approaches discussed in lab-on-a-chip systems?
x Check-valve pumps and diffuser/nozzle pumps
x Peristaltic pumps
x Electroosmotic flow-based pumps
Centrifugal pumps only used in large industrial plants
