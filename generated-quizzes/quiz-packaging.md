Question 5
10 / 10 pts
Which of the following is an advantage of eutectic die attach compared to epoxy die attach?
x Superior thermal and electrical properties for high-power and high-frequency chips
Lower processing temperature and no need for precise temperature control

Question 6
10 / 10 pts
In epoxy die attach, what is a key risk of an overcured epoxy?
x The epoxy may become brittle and lead to weaker joints
The epoxy will remain soft and never fully harden
The epoxy will automatically compensate for CTE mismatch
The epoxy will convert to a eutectic alloy at high temperature

Question 7

Question 9
10 / 10 pts
In the context of semiconductor packaging, what does “pitch” refer to?
