Question 3
10 / 10 pts
In RF resonator design, what does the quality factor (Q) represent?
x The ratio of a resonator’s center frequency to its bandwidth

Question 4
10 / 10 pts
What is the main purpose of integrating MEMS-based actuators into printed antennas in reconfigurable RF antenna designs?
x To dynamically reconfigure or steer the antenna beam and change beam shape
To permanently fix the antenna radiation pattern during fabrication
To increase the antenna’s physical size for better handling
To eliminate the need for any RF front-end electronics

Question 5
