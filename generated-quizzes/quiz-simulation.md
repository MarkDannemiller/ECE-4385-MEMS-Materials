Question 1
10 / 10 pts
Which of the following is NOT listed as a task ANSYS finite element analysis software enables engineers to perform?
x Bake semiconductor wafers during fabrication
Build computer models or transfer CAD models of structures and systems
Apply operating loads or other design performance conditions
Study physical responses such as stress, temperature, or electromagnetic fields

Question 2
10 / 10 pts
In ANSYS, what does “meshing” refer to?
x Breaking up structures into smaller pieces and linking them with physical equations and boundary conditions
Automatically correcting all geometry errors in imported CAD models
Displaying color contour plots of simulation results
Generating manufacturing toolpaths from the model

Question 3
10 / 10 pts
Which ANSYS processor is used to build the model by defining geometry, materials, and element types?
x The general preprocessor (PREP7)
The solution processor (SOLUTION)
The general postprocessor (POST1)
The Begin level

Question 4
10 / 10 pts
In ANSYS terminology, what is meant by “loads”?
x Boundary conditions and externally or internally applied forcing functions
Externally applied mechanical forces
Thermal boundary conditions such as fixed temperatures
Electrical voltages applied at nodes based on meshed result.

Question 5
10 / 10 pts
In the MEMS thermal actuator example, what physical effect primarily causes the actuator to bend toward the blade?
x Differential thermal expansion due to greater Joule heating in the thin arm than in the blade
Uniform cooling of both arms by ambient air
Magnetic attraction between the arm and the blade
Electrostatic repulsion between the electrical pads
