Question 1
10 / 10 pts
Why are nanocoatings engineered for MEMS surfaces?
x To change surface properties without significantly altering bulk material properties
To increase the thickness and stiffness of the MEMS structures
To eliminate the need for packaging
To raise the electrical resistance of all device layers

Question 2
10 / 10 pts
In the context of MEMS, what is “stiction”?
x Unwanted static friction/adhesion between contacting surfaces that degrades performance and lifetime
Desired friction used to lock moving parts in place
Magnetic attraction between two conductive surfaces
Electrothermal warping due to Joule heating

Question 3
10 / 10 pts
Stiction-based failure in MEMS occurs when:
x Surface adhesion forces exceed the actuation force
Actuation force is much larger than adhesion
Only electrostatic forces are present
The device is operated in vacuum

Question 4
10 / 10 pts
Which of the following are fundamental contributors to stiction forces in MEMS?
x Capillary forces
x Van der Waals forces
x Electrostatic forces
Nuclear forces in the silicon lattice

Question 5
10 / 10 pts
Which of the following is NOT a common strategy for alleviating stiction in MEMS?
x Increasing surface area and making surfaces perfectly flat
Minimizing contact area with dimples and curved surfaces
Roughening the surface by selective etching
Applying anti-stiction coatings such as SAMs or plasma-deposited films

Question 6
10 / 10 pts
Texas Instruments uses which type of chemistry on its Digital Micromirror Device (DMD) to minimize stiction and enable “healing” inside a hermetically sealed package?
x Perfluorinated n-alkanoic acids such as perfluorinated decanoic acid (PFDA)
Nickel-based electroplated coatings
Pure alumina (Al₂O₃) only
Gold-thick film metallization

Question 7
10 / 10 pts
For Analog Devices ADXL accelerometers, how are siloxane-based nanocoatings typically applied?
x A small aliquot is dispensed in the package, the package is sealed, and heating causes the liquid to evaporate and form an organic monolayer
The die is dipped in molten siloxane and rapidly cooled
Siloxane is sputtered in a high-vacuum metal deposition chamber
The coating is screen-printed on top of the package lid only

Question 8
10 / 10 pts
Which statement best describes the role of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) in MEMS nanocoatings?
x They form ultra-thin, ordered molecular layers that dramatically reduce surface energy and stiction
They are thick polymer layers used to mechanically reinforce beams
They are metallic films used primarily for electrical interconnects
They are only used as photoresists in lithography

Question 9
10 / 10 pts
Which tools are commonly used to characterize nano-coated surfaces and their properties?
x Contact angle goniometer and SEM
x TEM and XPS
x AFM for topography and force–distance measurements
Wire-bond pull tester only

Question 10
10 / 10 pts
What is the primary objective of the MEMS “Tribogauge” device?
x To provide in-situ characterization of nano-tribological phenomena such as stiction, friction, and wear
To generate large electrostatic actuation forces for power devices
To serve as a standard accelerometer for automotive airbags
To measure only thermal conductivity of coatings
