Question 4
10 / 10 pts
According to the lecture definitions, what is verification?
x Predictive analysis to ensure that the synthesized design, when manufactured, will perform the given I/O function
A manufacturing step that ensures the physical device has no defects

10 / 10 pts
Which test stage involves exhaustive testing, evaluation of worst cases, and statistical analysis?
x Characterization test
Production test at wafer probe
Final test of packaged devices
Post burn-in screening

Question 7
10 / 10 pts
In the lecture, what is the term for the fraction (or percentage) of good chips that are rejected by the tests?
x Yield loss
Defect level
Process capability
Test coverage

Question 8
10 / 10 pts
In this course, ATE is defined as:

Question 9
10 / 10 pts
How is standard deviation defined in the variability discussion?
x The square root of the variance

The variance squared
The difference between the maximum and minimum observations

Question 10
10 / 10 pts
According to the process capability discussion, a process with Cpk greater than 1 is generally associated with:
