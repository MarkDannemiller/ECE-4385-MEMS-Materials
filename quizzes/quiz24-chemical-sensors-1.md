Question 1
10 / 10 pts
How does pulse-width modulation (PWM) create grayscale images in DLP systems?
x By switching mirrors on and off for different durations within a frame
  By varying the light wavelength
  By adjusting the mirror angle continuously
  By changing the mirror size dynamically

Question 2
10 / 10 pts
Which property is measured using the Zygo NewView Scanning White Light Interferometer during DMD testing?
  Optical reflectivity
x Vertical displacement and surface profile
  Thermal expansion coefficient
  Electrostatic charge distribution

Question 3
10 / 10 pts
What manufacturing technique is used to create the micromirrors and their support structures?
  Ion implantation
  CVD on silicon wafers
x Plasma etching with sacrificial layer removal
  Laser lithography

Question 4
10 / 10 pts
Why was surface micromachining essential for the development of the DMD?
  It allowed creation of curved mirrors for better reflection.
x It enabled batch fabrication of movable microstructures on CMOS circuitry.
  It allowed mirrors to rotate continuously.
  It reduced the power requirements of the light source.

Question 5

What mechanical structure allows each micromirror to tilt between its two stable positions?
x Flexure hinges with torsion beams
  Electrostatic comb drive
  Piezoelectric actuator arms
