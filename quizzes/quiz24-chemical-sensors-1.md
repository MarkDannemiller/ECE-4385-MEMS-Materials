Question 3
10 / 10 pts
What is the typical response time (rise and fall) for a Nafion-based humidity sensor?
  Rise: 500–1000 ms, Fall: 200–300 ms
x Rise: 50–100 ms, Fall: 20–30 ms
  Rise: 1–5 s, Fall: 0.5–2 s
  Rise: 10–20 ms, Fall: 1–2 ms

Question 4
10 / 10 pts
What is the primary purpose of the Teflon (tetrafluoroethylene) backbone in the Nafion polymer used for humidity sensors?
  It enhances the electrical conductivity of the sensor.
  It acts as a catalyst for water dissociation.
x It provides structural support and chemical stability.
  It increases the optical absorption of water molecules.

Question 5
10 / 10 pts
What happens to the current through a Nafion-based humidity sensor as relative humidity increases?
  It oscillates periodically due to hysteresis.
x It increases because absorbed water produces more ions.
  It remains constant once a threshold voltage is reached.
