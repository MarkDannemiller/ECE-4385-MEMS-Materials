Question 2
10 / 10 pts
In a parallel plate actuator, the electrostatic force is always:

  Zero, when plates are aligned
  Dependent on current
x Attractive

Question 3
10 / 10 pts
"Pull-in" in electrostatic actuators refers to:
  Gradual deflection due to thermal expansion
  Increased resistance in the circuit
x Nonlinear instability causing plates to collapse together
  Loss of capacitance due to stiction

Question 4
10 / 10 pts
The pseudo-analog micromirror concept achieves grayscale displacement by:
x Turning on binary-area electrodes in different combinations
  Using variable spring stiffness via magnetic coupling
  Applying analog voltages to a single electrode at high frequency
  Mechanically adjusting mirror arm lengths
