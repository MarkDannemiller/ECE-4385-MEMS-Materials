Question 1
10 / 10 pts
What principle do electrothermal actuators primarily use to create motion?
  Electrostatic attraction
  Magnetic induction
  Piezoelectric effect
x Thermal expansion

Question 2
10 / 10 pts
Increasing the leg length of a chevron actuator generally results in:
  Increased displacement, increased force
  Decreased displacement, decreased force
  Decreased displacement, increased force
x Increased displacement, decreased force

Question 3
10 / 10 pts
In thermal bimorph actuators, bending occurs because:
  Both layers have identical thermal expansion coefficients
  Heat is evenly distributed across the structure
  Current flow is minimized
x One layer expands more than the other when heated

Question 4
10 / 10 pts
Why is vertical (z-axis) motion more difficult to achieve in MEMS devices than in-plane motion?
  Limited thermal expansion coefficients
  Higher gravitational forces at the microscale
  Material limitations
x The 2-D nature of fabrication processes

Question 5
10 / 10 pts
The force-displacement product (F × d) is used as:
  A fabrication yield metric
x A measure of actuation efficiency
  A thermal conductivity constant
  An electrical resistance measurement
